# Space Invader Clone

Fairly simple space invader clone, but I'll be using some of the more advanced things I've learned over the years.

While not 100% yet, as of 5/29/2020 I've decided to go ahead and add in some documentation and prepare to add it to GIT.

I held off on shooting it up to GIT simply due to building it from scratch and not wanting to have the repo be 500 commits deep before actually being playable.

Right now, it's in a semi playable state, it doesn't have anything fancy, entity objects aren't fully integrated and there's literally no polish what-so-ever, but it's at least in a state where it runs.

We'll call this Alpha version 0.1, in it's current state, it's more a demo than a game, but I'm planning on finishing this completely.
